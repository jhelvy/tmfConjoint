pilot1.1

  - Reads in full DOE from github and does parsing on the fly.
  - DOE bare minimum.
  - Trip plots done in real time.

pilot1.2

  - Loads all questions at once, but requires scrolling from one question to next

pilot2.1

  - Reads in individual trip csv files for each respondent.
  - Improved DOE to make good trip plots.
  - Trip plots done in real time.

pilot3.1

  - Reads in individual trip csv files for each respondent.
  - Trip plots improved, now includes car express lane and walking in mid legs.
  - Trip plots done in real time.

pilot3.2
  - Same as 3.1 but uses saved trip images for increased survey speed.

pilot4.1

  - DOE split for respondents with and without car.
  - Back to dynamically creating plots. Saving images is not any faster and
    significantly more complex.

pilot5

  - Split for respondents with and without car.
  - Dynamic plots
  - Time for each leg

pilot6

  - Same as 5 but has all the times on the left and modes on the right.
  - Dynamic plots
  - Time for each leg

pilot7

  - Graphics: Version a uses pilot5, version b uses pilot6
  - Uses fread with filtering while reading for speed
  - Includes both no cars and with cars options in the same survey
  - Dynamic plotting
  - Time specified for each leg

pilot7a

  - Same as 7 but uses respondent DOE as json so no need to re-load full DOE

pilot8

  - Uses saved images as png files hosted on jhelvy.com for increased speed
  - Saves full trip information in the image, so no need to load the DOE
  - Includes both no cars and with cars options in the same survey
  - Time specified for each leg in trip plots
